# Editor Extensions
Editor Extensions appends the Factorio map editor with tons of new features, useful both for scenario creation and for testing builds. Quickly swap between the editor and normal play, generate or destroy infinite items, fluids, electricity, or heat, gain access to supercharged versions of many vanilla items and entities, and more!

Designed to be a replacement for the Creative Mode and Infinity Mode mods.
